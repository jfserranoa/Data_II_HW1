# Data and Programming II - Homework 1
## Data Cleaning Exercise: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
* File labeled **"Total"**: Has total annual employment per state for the years 2000 and 2017.
* File labeled **"by industry"**: Has employment per industry in each of 10 industries per state for the years 2000 and 2017.
* Load and merge the data into a panel dataframe, with the columns: **"state"**, **"year"**, and one for each of the 10 industries. Every state-year combination should uniquely identify a row. No more and no less than 12 columns should remain. Do any necessary cleaning for the data to be easily usable.
